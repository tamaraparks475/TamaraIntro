# Tamara Parks 

I am a communicator of my experiences, thoughts, emotions, beliefs, fears, and 
so on. Through this communication– verbal, physical, 
spiritual, or any other form– I see myself, not only as 
a creation but a creator.

Below I have exemplified, under three catagories, some ways I show up. Enjoy!
